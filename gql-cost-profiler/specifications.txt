Project: GraphQL Cost Profiler

Objective:
Develop a Go-based tool to analyze, estimate, and enforce computational cost limits on incoming GraphQL queries, enhancing API reliability, security, and performance.

---

Functional Requirements:

1. Query Parsing & Analysis
   - Parse GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions using a Go GraphQL library.
   - Support parsing of fragments, variables, and inline fragments.
   - Extract operation names and variables for context-aware analysis.

2. Cost Model Configuration
   - Allow assignment of static and dynamic cost values to schema fields and types.
   - Support configuration via YAML/JSON file and/or Go code.
   - Enable default cost values and per-field/type overrides.
   - Allow cost multipliers for list fields and arguments (e.g., pagination).

3. Cost Calculation Engine
   - Traverse the GraphQL AST to compute total query cost.
   - Account for nested fields, fragments, recursion, and query depth.

4. Enforcement & Integration
   - Provide middleware for Go GraphQL servers (e.g., gqlgen, graphql-go).
   - Reject, throttle, or log queries exceeding a configurable cost threshold.
   - Return descriptive error messages for rejected queries.
   - Allow per-user or per-role cost limits (optional).

5. Reporting & Observability
   - Log query cost, operation name, user info, and timestamp.
   - Expose an HTTP endpoint for cost analysis and health checks.
   - Optionally export metrics (e.g., Prometheus) for monitoring.

6. Testing & Validation
   - Include comprehensive unit and integration tests.
   - Provide example queries, schemas, and expected cost outputs.
   - Validate configuration files and schema annotations.

7. Documentation
   - Document configuration, usage, and integration steps.
   - Provide code examples and best practices.
   - Include troubleshooting and FAQ sections.

Non-Functional Requirements:

- Performance: Minimal overhead on query execution (<10% latency increase).
- Security: Prevent resource exhaustion and denial-of-service via cost enforcement.
- Extensibility: Modular design for easy integration with different GraphQL servers and custom cost models.
- Compatibility: Support for Go 1.20+ and major GraphQL libraries.
- Usability: Clear error messages and configuration validation.
